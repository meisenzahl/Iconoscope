// Widget Wrapping Idiom
// ---------------------
//
// Gtk uses reference counting of its objects. As a convenience for C
// programming they have a feature called "floating references", this feature
// makes most objects be created with a floating reference, instead of a normal
// one. Then the object that will take ownership of it, calls
// g_object_ref_sink() and becomes the owner of this floating reference making
// it a normal one. This allows C code to not call g_object_unref() on the newly
// created object and not leak a reference (and thus, not leak memory).
//
// The problem is this only work for objects that inherit from the
// GInitialyUnowned class. In all the Gtk class hierarchy ~150 classes inherit
// from GInitiallyUnowned and ~100 don't, which makes floating references the
// common case. What I normally do is assume things use floating references, and
// never call g_object_ref_sink() under the assumption that the function I'm
// passing the object to will sink it.
//
// Doing this for GtkWidgets is very useful to implement changes in the UI
// without creating a tangle of signals. What I do is completely replace widgets
// that need to be updated, instead of trying to update the state of objects to
// reflect changes. I keep weak references (C pointers, not even Gtk weak
// references) to widgets that may need to be replaced, then I remove the widget
// from it's container and replace it by a new one. Here not taking references
// to any widget becomes useful as removing the widget form it's parent will
// have the effect of destroying all the children objects (as long as Gtk
// internally isn't leaking memory).
//
// The only issue I've found is that containers like GtkPaned or GtkGrid use
// special _add methods with different declaration than gtk_container_add().
// It's very common to move widgets accross different kinds of containers, which
// adds the burden of having to kneo where in the code we assumed something was
// stored in a GtkGrid or a GtkPaned etc. What I do to alieviate this pain is
// wrap widgets that will be replaced into a GtkBox with wrap_gtk_widget() and
// then use replace_wrapped_widget() to replace it.
//
// Doing this ties the lifespan of an GInitiallyUnowned object to the lifespan
// of the parent. Sometimes this is not desired, in those cases we must call
// g_object_ref_sink() (NOT g_object_ref(), because as far as I understand it
// will set refcount to 2 and never free them). Fortunatelly cases where this is
// required will print lots of Critical warnings or crash the application so
// they are easy to detect and fix, a memory leak is harder to detect/fix.
//
// NOTE: The approach of storing a pointer to the parent widget not only doubles
// the number of pointers that need to be stored for a replacable widget, but
// also doesn't work because we can't know the true parent of a widget. For
// instance, GtkScrolledWindow wraps its child in a GtkViewPort.
//
// TODO: I need a way to detect when I'm using objects that don't inherit from
// GInitiallyUnowned and be sure we are not leaking references. Also make sure
// g_object_ref_sink() is used instead of g_object_ref().

// An issue with the wrapped widget idiom is that if a widget triggers a replace
// of one of its ancestors, then we are effectiveley destroying ourselves from
// the signal handler. I've found cases where Gtk does not like that and shows
// lots of critical errors. I think these errors happen because the signal where
// we triggered the destruction of the ancestor is not the only one being
// handled, then after destruction, other handlers try to trigger inside the
// widget that does not exist anymore.
//
// I don't know if this is a Gtk bug, or we are not supposed to trigger the
// destruction of an object from the signal handler of a signal of the object
// that will be destroyed. The case I found not to work was a GtkCombobox
// destroying itself from the "changed" signal. A button destroying itself from
// the "clicked" signal worked fine though.
//
// In any case, if this happens, the function replace_wrapped_widget_defered()
// splits widget replacement so that widget destruction is triggered, and then
// in the handler for the destroy signal, we actually replace the widget. Not
// nice, but seems to solve the issue.

// The implementation of GtkPaned is so broken that faking it by using a GtkGrid
// works better. This still lacks the resizability which is why I use
// fix_gtk_paned_new(), but at this point I think it will be much simpler to
// just make my own implementation of a Paned container than try to make
// GtkPaned work. Some of the issues found are:
//
//   - There is no way to position the separator based on a percentage. Trying
//     to implement this required a lot of code, and even then, it didn't work.
//
//   - Trying to set the position as pixels works, except when doing it from
//     inside the handler for size-allocate. Which is what made the
//     implementation of a percentage positioning not work.
//
//   - Thin separators (1px) are broken. See the comment above in
//     fix_gtk_paned_new().
//
//   - Even after solving the bug and writing to the mailing list about it, I
//     got no response (it was a single line change). Which makes me think no
//     one really wants to touch that code. And with good reason, it's very
//     weird and has strange corner cases (why is there a position-set property
//     to activate/deactivate the position property?).
//
//   - Even when working around the bugs, 1px separators are still useless.
//     The hitbox is 1px wide which makes them extremely annoying.
//
//   - Sometimes (who knows why) the first child is not drawn, but it is
//     allocated.
//
//   - Reproducing these bugs on simpler test cases is hard, because they depend
//     on the order in which size allocations happen.
//
// I'm very tired of this. This is the only way I found to create something that
// looks like a static paned container, that actually shows both widgets at
// startup, and where I can control the position to be tight around one of the
// children.
